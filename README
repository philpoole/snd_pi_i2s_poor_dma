Raspberry PI PCM I2S driver (POOR DMA)
======================================

This repository contains a very poor quality I2S PCM ALSA driver
for Raspberry Pi.
This time it uses DMA in a crude fashion. See below for known issues.
It is purely for demonstration purposes.

It will output 16 bits per sample, 44100Hz stereo I2S to use with a
DAC similar to the TDA1541A. If you require different format or frequency
then feel free to modify this driver to suit, but I can't guarantee support.

This is a kernel driver, so in order to build this, you will need to be running
a successfully built kernel, for which you have the kernel source code to which 
this driver can be built against.

To build..
make -C /home/pi/linux M=$PWD
(if your linux source tree lives at /home/pi/linux, for instance) 


Known bugs; it will freeze if mpc stop is called, and if you the next track
will be garbled unless you call mpc next.
However, it glitches far less than the non DMA version (snd_pi_i2s), even with USB HDD tracks.
